Notebook description:

Hello everyone you can find Jupyter notebook in Model folder and dataset in data folder
This Jupyter notbook we devide into section wise as bellow

1)  First import all libraries 
2)  Read train/test data from excel file
3)  Data profiling
4)  Data cleaning/ preprocessing
5)  Model training
6)  Model Evalution

Conclusion: we use following models Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes. out of this Random Forest Classifier is working best for this dataset

Hope u will find this informative.
